This is a simple platform wherein admin can create and users give test. We have implemented several features some of them are listed below -
* Authentication - two types of accounts can be created user and admin.
* Test creation, updation, deleting, etc can be performed by the admin. Users on the other hand can give tests.
* Users can search through available tests.
* Users can check results of given tests.
* Set of questions for every user is different. We randomize the questions at the backend and then send questions to the users.
